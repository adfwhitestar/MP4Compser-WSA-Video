# MP4Compser-WSA-Video
This is a repo to show what is happening when you use mp4 composer with WSA 1.8.32836.0

This repo holds two videos.
One is before running the composer on the video one is after. 
Repo:
https://github.com/MasayukiSuda/Mp4Composer-android

This repo was not created to bash this dev in any way I am just curious as to if anyone know what is happening and if there is anyone that may be able to shed some light on why it does not work and how it could possibly get fixed. 

## Mp4Composer is Awesome and I love how easy it is to use. Im just at loss when it does not work. Thanks you in advance to anyone that helps fix this issue or gives a path on an idea that may help.
